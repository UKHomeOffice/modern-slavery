    <p>If you’re not sure of the potential victim’s age, you’ll need to refer them to the relevant local authority for an age assessment. They will continue to be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.</p>
    <p>If they’re under 18 or you’re not sure, you must explain to them how organisations such as the Home Office will use their information.</p>
