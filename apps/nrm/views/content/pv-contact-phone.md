If the potential victim wants to receive support and does not have a telephone number, <a href="/support-organisations" target="_blank">you can contact the support provider (opens in new tab)</a> for them.

This will help facilitate contact between the support provider and the potential victim, so that they can be entered into Modern Slavery Victim Care Contract support.

If the potential victim does not have their own telephone number, you can provide alternative contact details. Make sure you explain who's contact details these are, check they agree and are safe to be contacted.
